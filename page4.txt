      <b> <i> <u> 1. Balete Drive </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
     This famous two-lane street in Quezon City is believed to be the haunted by a white-veiled lady who frequents the site. The tree-lined road adds an eerie feeling, as if something will appear in front of you at any time. It was told that the white-veiled lady is the ghost of a girl who died in a car accident in the area when she lost her way, which is why she has been trying to hitch a ride and find her way home. Other stories indicated that it is the ghost of a young lady who died in the Spanish era. Rumors or not, you better not drive by Balete Drive alone.

      <b> <i> <u> 2. Bahay na Pula </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      Just less than two hours from Manila is the <i> <b> Bahay na Pula, </i> </b> located in San Ildefonso in the province of Bulacan. It is a house that cannot be missed due to its proximity to the highway. Bahay na Pula, or The Red House, got its name from the hue that it exudes, which is as red as blood and rust. The house transports you to a location that you only see in classic horror films. It is considered as one of the tourist destinations in Central Luzon for ghost hunters, and its distinct feature cannot go unnoticed. <br>
    It is believed that this ancestral house was the place where women were held captive during the Japanese era and where they eventually died during their stay. Some guerillas are also tortured and burned here. This is the reason why some visitors believe that the red hue of the house might be the blood that flowed within the vicinity, tainting it forever. Wailing sounds, screams, and temperature shifts, as well as the ghastly feeling of someone looking from behind your back, are some of the most commonly shared experiences. </br>

      <b> <i> <u> 3. Clark Air Base Hospital </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      Hospitals are known to be generally scary, considering that many people do die here. However, this abandoned hospital in Clark Air Base is noted as one, if not the scariest abandoned hospital in the country. Featured in a National Geographic documentary in 2013, hundreds of stories have been associated with this medical complex because of its history and the spine-tingling vibe that you feel the moment you enter the premises. Visiting this place during the day is already scary enough, imagine the haunting feeling after dusk.

      <b> <i> <u> 5.Malinta Tunnel </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
       The historic Corregidor hosts some of the most haunted places in the Philippines. Thanks to its bloody history that stretches through the World War II, some of the places here managed to fill up the spots in the most scariest places in the world. The <i> <b> Malinta Tunnel <i> </b> is one of the eeriest places in the island. Like any other tunnels that can give you an uneasy feeling of being confined, this tunnel is one of the places in the island where lots of soldiers died. Shadows, unexplainable noises, and even sudden draft as well as temperature changes have been reported to manifest here.
