      <b> <i> <u> 1. Pagpag </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      It is customary in the Philippines to avoid going home after attending a wake because <br>
      it is thought that the deceased’s spirit will follow the person. To shake off any spirits <br>
      othat may have followed you from the wake, you must make a <i> <b> “pagpag,” </i> </b> or stopover, <br>
      somewhere other than your own house.</br>

      <b> <i> <u> 2. Bringing Home Food </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      You should never take food from a wake home, according to superstitions. Because if <br>
      you do anything otherwise, you can bring terrible misfortunes or even the deceased <br>
      person’s soul into your home. </br>

      <b> <i> <u> 3.Sukob </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      The <i> <b> “sukob” </i> </b> superstition forbids siblings from getting married in the same year. The <br>
      elders regard this as a curse. Either a family member will pass away, or the fortune will <br>
     be divided between the two married couples. </br>

      <b> <i> <u> 4. Tabi-tabi po </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      It is a customary courtesy to say <i> <b> “Tabi-tabi po” </i> </b> (excuse me) when walking in areas that <br>
      are uninhabited. It is a way of not disturbing the elements in the area. Locals believe <br>
       hat if you don’t say it, these elements will cause you sickness. </br>

      <b> <i> <u> 5. Knock On Wood </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      It is a widely held belief that one should knock on wood in order to negate the bad <br>
      emark or bad joke he or she has spoken of. Otherwise, it will happen. </br>
