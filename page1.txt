      <b> <i> <u> 1. Tiyanak </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      The <b> <i> Tiyanak </b> </i> is a man-eating earthly creature that preys on human flesh and blood. <br>
      This Filipino monster lurks in the darkness, luring unwary travellers away from safety by taking the form <br>
      of an infant child and crying like one too. As the kindhearted soul goes deeper and deeper into the forest <br>
      looking for the lost baby, the <i> tiyanak </i> will strike and eat its prey. </br>

     <font size="5" font color=black face="Aptos Display"> <br>  A <i> <b>“tiyanak” </i> </b> is described in popular culture as a hideous, demonic, and bloodthirsty child who usually preys on pregnant women or unfortunate souls who go into the woods.
This terrifying mythological creature has inspired many ghost stories and horror movies here in the Philippines, but have you ever wondered what could have started such a horrific urban legend? <br>
ccording to a special Halloween episode of GMA’s “Pinoy Klasiks,” the word tiyanak is said to be derived from the words “mati” and “anak,” which translates to “dead child.”

A legend from Mindanao suggests tiyanaks are souls of children whose mothers had died while giving birth, so they are left alone to become frightening demonic creatures.

Meanwhile, other Southeast Asian nations like Malaysia and Indonesia have similar legends about women who died during childbirth called the “pontianak.” <br>
The Catholic Church was also known to have made use of the urban legend to encourage parents to have their children baptized.

As Prof. Nestor Castro of the UP Department of Anthropology explained it, such stories about tiyanak were products of common unfortunate occurrences that happen during childbirth.


“Laganap ito dahil merong common na nagaganap sa mga buntis na maaaring dahil sa peligro ng panganganak ay makunan sila, mapapanganak ang bata pero mamamatay ang ina, o kaya pareho silang mamamatay,” Castro said. <br>
“Ito ay parang isang pagtawag na hindi dapat ganito ang mangyari, ang ganitong pangyayari sa ating mga nanay at mga buntis,” he added.

Wherever the stories may have originated, Castro also believed the legend of the tiyanak could serve as a reminder for society to take proper care of pregnant mothers.

“Noong unang panahon naman kasi hindi alam ng mga tao kung bakit namatay sa panganganak ang isang nanay dahil wala pa talagang access sa mga ospital, pero ang pinaka-importante doon ay mag-ingat at huwag pabayaan ang ganitong maselang kalagayan,” he said. </br> </p>

      <b> <i> <u> 2. Tikbalang </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      Described as a hulking half-man, half-horse that towers over mortal creatures, with broad, muscular
      shoulders and a majestic horse’s head, the <b> <i> Tikbalang </b> </i> is an elemental god frightening, intimidating, and imperial. </br>

     <font size="4" face="Aptos Display"> <br> (I hope you run like a horse when you see this Filipino monster called Tikbalang in the middle of the night.)</br>

   

     <font size="5" font color=black face="Aptos Display"> <br> Found in the Philippines’ far-flung mountains, he watches over his domain like a guardian and looks over <br>

     anyone who enters. As stories go, the <i> Tikbalang </i> is a mischievous god and can trick you into losing your <br>
    way in the forest, trapping you forever by making you walk around endlessly in circles. <br>

    They said that the secret to lifting the magic of the, <i> Tikbalang </i> is by taking your shirt and turning it inside <br>
    out. Only then will you be able to see the forest as it is and maybe find your way home. </br> </P>










<p>
      <font size="5" font color=black face="Mangal">
      <b> <i> <u> 3.Sigbin </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      The <b> <i> Sigbin </b> </i> is a unique entry in Filipino mythical creatures. While it is considered a supernatural entity, <br>
      it’s often believed that some Filipino families keep the <b> <i> Sigbin </b> </i> as a pet. </br>

<p> 
     <font size="4" face="Aptos Display"> <br> (You should run home and lock all your doors if ever you encounter a <i> Sigbin </i> in the Philippines.)</br>

   

     <font size="5" font color=black face="Aptos Display"> <br> The <i> Sigbin </i>  is a dog-like creature that is visible only to its owner. It eats any raw meat, preferably bloody <br>
    and freshly slaughtered. When you keep a <i> Sigbin </i> as a pet, it will be your silent guardian. It will protect <br>

    you from danger, bring good luck, and will even let you ride it though you will only appear to be walking <br>
   briskly to other people. <br>
    However, let a <i> Sigbin </i> starve, and it will not just turn on you; it will savage and eat your entire family as well. </br> </P>








<p>
      <font size="5" font color=black face="Mangal">
      <b> <i> <u> 4. Kapre </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      The <b> <i> Kapre </b> </i> like <i> Tikbalang, </i> is less of a monster and more of a deity that watches over locals and farm animals. <br>
      They are unusually tall and muscular, with dark skin and hairy chests, but they can also take the form of beautiful, <br>
       inviting men if they want to seduce people into following them. </br>

      </p>

</marquee>
<p> 
     <font size="4" face="Aptos Display"> <br> (If you see a big old Balete tree like the one in Baler, Aurora, the chance of a <i> Kapre </i> living there is almost high.)</br>

   

    <font size="5" font color=black face="Aptos Display"> <br> They said that the <i> kapre, </i> like many Filipino mythical creatures, can play tricks on a person’s mind. If <br>
    someone suddenly forgets where they are or gets strangely confused, people say that this could be the <br>
    work of a <i> kapre </i> working its magic. </br> </P>




<p>
      <font size="5" font color=black face="Mangal">
      <b> <i> <u> 5. Duwende </i> </u> </b>
      <br>
      Filipino mythical creatures also have the <b> <i> Duwende, </b> </i> the local equivalent of dwarves. But unlike in Snow White,<br>
      they’re a lot more fickle, playing nasty tricks on the people they don’t like and showering gifts on those that they do like.</br>    
      </font>
      </p>
<marquee behavior="alternate" direction="left">
<img src=" duwende.jpg" style="float:middle" width="500" height="500"/>

<p> 
     <font size="4" face="Aptos Display"> <br> (Beware the cheeky little <i> Duwende </i>. They love to play and fool you.)</br>

   

    <font size="5" font color=black face="Aptos Display"> <br> Beware of the <i> Duwende‘s </i> gifts. Even among Filipino monsters, they are notorious for being very jealous <br>
    and quite vicious in their anger. They are known to suddenly go from being extravagantly generous to <br>
    become mean and spiteful all in a split second! </br> </P>
